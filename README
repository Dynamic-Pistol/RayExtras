# RayExtras

Rayextras is a package to speed up game development and add useful utilities to help in making your game!

## Includes

- Drawing utilities
- Rectanlge utilities
- Gradients
- Input maps based on enum arrays
- Raylib logger to Odin logger
- LetterBox
- Preloading assets and embedding them into binary


## Usage

To use, either do `git clone https://github.com/Dynamic-Pistol/RayExtras.git` into your project, or download the files you need for your project only

None of the files depend on each other, meaning you can use whatever you want, this may change in the future and will most likely only depend on certain features

## Contribution

You can submit issues and prs to help, keep the following in mind though:

- Use Odin formatter
- Use Raylib's naming scheme
- Don't delete procedures without a valid reason
- Preferably create new branches based off main, rebase them and then submit those as prs
- Preferably create a proposal issue to first to see if your feature would get accepted
